### Film Query Project
This is a Film Query Application.  
#### User Instructions
A user is presented with a prompt to start the application.
Once the application starts, the user can choose whether to look up a movie by ID, by keyword,
or they can choose to quit.  
#### Look up by ID
If the user chooses to look up by ID, the user can enter a valid
number which represents the ID; if a match is found, a title is returned, if a match is not found,
the user will see a message about the result.
####Look up by keyword
If the user chooses to look up by keyword, the user can enter a search term; if a match or
matches are found, they will all be returned.  If no matches are found, the user will see a
message about the result.

####A few notes about the development process
I met all of the required user stories relatively faster than I did with previous projects.
I'm still not super quick about putting the pieces together but I found that I was able to follow
the path of execution a lot easier because I have a better understanding of how classes work
with each other, how to properly call methods, how to minimize repetitive code, how to catch
bad user input, and how to anticipate problems by simply asking myself "What kind of problems might
arise at runtime"?  While I did use the debugger, the program was still compact enough to be able to
trace through it to find where things were going wrong.  I found many of the problems by trying to
follow the path the way that Java would.  

####A few notes
I was able to successfully use a try/catch for one of the user input blocks to try to catch bad input because,
do users always enter good input?  These were the questions I asked throughout the project.  I find
myself constantly asking these questions:
  - How can I make this code more readable?
  - Have I tried my best to anticipate problems that are out of my control?
  - Am I repeating code that could be simplified?
  - Am I properly encapsulating my variables?
